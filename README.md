# Inifinte-Scroll

#How it works/
On-load the page will display X numbers of random photos. Scroll down to a certain amount, it will automatically load more random photos.

If user search with a specific (from the search option) keyword, it will clear the page and display photos based on that keyword. At this stage, if user continue to scroll down, more photos will load based on before specified keyword.

Added auto increment page numbers to prevent loading duplicate photos.

From the filter menu, user can apply filter on 'keyword based search'. Filtered values will not apply for random search.

'random' keyword search will return to random photos.
